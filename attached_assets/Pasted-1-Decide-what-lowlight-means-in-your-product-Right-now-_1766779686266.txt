1) Decide what “lowlight” means in your product

Right now you’re implicitly using “lowlight” as “anything not great,” but users interpret it as “negative / risk / problem.”

Pick one definition and enforce it:

Definition A (recommended): Lowlight = risk, weakness, confusion, boredom, credibility gap, marketability blocker, craft issue.

Definition B: Lowlight = lower emotional intensity / less memorable moment (can still be positive).
If you want A, you must write that explicitly; otherwise the model will drift toward B.

2) Enforce a rubric + severity score (so it can’t stay “nice”)

Require each lowlight to include:

Issue type (pacing / clarity / character / tone / audio / lighting / story logic / marketability)

Severity (1–5)

Why it matters (impact)

Fix suggestion (optional but useful)

Evidence (timestamp + quote)

This makes it hard for the model to produce “lowlight: very nice scene!”

3) Force a balanced ratio and minimum negativity

If you want “real criticism,” you need a quota.

Examples:

“Return exactly 5 highlights and 5 lowlights.”

“At least 3 lowlights must be severity ≥ 3.”

“At least 2 lowlights must be marketability risks.”

Without ratio constraints, the model will tend to “play safe.”

4) Change the label in UI: “Concerns / Risks” works better than “Lowlight”

“Lowlight” reads like a tone label; “Concerns” forces problem framing.

Recommended UI:

Highlights

Concerns (with severity)

Opportunities (optional; turns “concerns” into actions)

If you must keep “lowlight,” add parenthetical: Lowlight (Issue/Risk).

5) Use a strict JSON schema output and validate it

Do not ask for free-form prose and then try to parse.

Example schema
{
  "highlights": [
    {
      "timestamp": "MM:SS–MM:SS",
      "summary": "...",
      "why_it_works": "...",
      "quote": "...",
      "category": "emotion|craft|clarity|marketability"
    }
  ],
  "lowlights": [
    {
      "timestamp": "MM:SS–MM:SS",
      "issue": "...",
      "impact": "...",
      "severity": 1,
      "category": "pacing|clarity|character|audio|visual|tone|marketability",
      "suggested_fix": "...",
      "quote": "..."
    }
  ]
}


Then validate:

must have N items

severity integer 1–5

timestamps present

lowlights must contain an “impact” that is actually negative

6) Concrete prompt block you can drop in (recommended)

Replace your vague section with something like:

Highlights vs Lowlights Definition and Requirements

HIGHLIGHT = moments that increase audience engagement, clarity, emotional impact, or commercial/festival appeal.

LOWLIGHT = moments that reduce engagement or clarity, create confusion, feel slow, undermine credibility, or hurt marketability (e.g., pacing drag, unclear stakes, tonal mismatch, weak performance beat, audio/visual distraction, or narrative logic gap).

Output constraints:

Provide exactly 5 highlights and exactly 5 lowlights.

Each lowlight must include: issue, impact, and severity (1–5) where 3 = meaningful problem.

At least 3 lowlights must have severity ≥ 3.

Do not soften criticism; write lowlights as a professional acquisitions/notes memo.

Use timestamps and include a short quote or specific described moment as evidence.

Return valid JSON only matching the schema.

This single block usually fixes 80% of “too positive” behavior.
