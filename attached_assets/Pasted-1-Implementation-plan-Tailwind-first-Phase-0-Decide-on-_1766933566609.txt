1) Implementation plan (Tailwind-first)
Phase 0: Decide on a density + type baseline (1 hour)

Pick one of these and apply globally:

Comfortable (recommended for filmmakers + CJK):

Base font: text-[17px] (EN) / text-[18px] (繁中 if you see thinness)

Line height: leading-7 (or leading-[1.75])

Section headers: text-xl font-semibold

Card titles: text-base font-semibold

Goal: readable, not sparse.

Phase 1: Add Tailwind tokens (0.5–1 day)

In tailwind.config.ts, add:

font family stack that supports Traditional Chinese well

a small set of radii

consistent shadows

neutral borders

a spacing policy (you’ll implement via class discipline, not config)

Deliverable: “design tokens” that every component uses.

Example tailwind.config.ts additions (agent-ready)
// tailwind.config.ts
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";

export default {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        sans: [
          "Inter",
          "Noto Sans TC",
          "ui-sans-serif",
          "system-ui",
          "sans-serif",
        ],
      },
      borderRadius: {
        xl: "16px",
        "2xl": "20px",
      },
      boxShadow: {
        soft: "0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)",
        card: "0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 12px 40px rgba(15,23,42,0.08)",
      },
      colors: {
        // Optional: define a small semantic palette if you’re not using CSS vars
        ink: {
          900: "#0B1220",
          700: "#263044",
          500: "#556070",
        },
      },
    },
  },
} satisfies Config;

Phase 2: Global typography + density pass (0.5–1 day)

Add a global base style (in your main CSS, e.g., index.css):

@layer base {
  html { -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale; }
  body { @apply font-sans text-[17px] leading-[1.75] text-slate-800 bg-slate-50; }
}


Then apply these principles:

Replace text-sm body copy with text-[15px] for secondary, text-[17px] for primary

Reduce empty vertical spacing:

replace many gap-8 with gap-4 or gap-5

replace many py-10 with py-6 etc. inside sections

Phase 3: Standardize 6 core UI primitives (1–2 days)

Create ui/ components with Tailwind classes so everything feels unified.

Build these:

Card

SectionHeader

Badge (timestamp)

Pill (category tag)

SeverityPill

Panel (right column blocks)

Use clsx + tailwind-merge for variants.

Key outcome: you stop manually styling every card and fix “inconsistent modernness.”

Phase 4: Layout tightening (1 day)

Keep your layout concept, but do these changes:

Use a consistent grid:

grid grid-cols-12 gap-6

left: col-span-8

right: col-span-4

Make right panel sticky:

sticky top-6 max-h-[calc(100vh-3rem)] overflow-auto

Convert right “Target response data” into:

Tabs: Goals | Profile | Summary
or an Accordion for goals.

This reduces the “two long scroll columns” feeling.

2) Concrete UI fixes I’d instruct your agent to implement
A) Make the UI less sparse without clutter

Reduce card padding: p-6 → p-5 (or p-4 for dense)

Reduce vertical gaps: gap-8 → gap-5

Increase body font size: text-sm → text-[15px] for secondary; text-[17px] for primary

Stronger heading scale:

“Executive Summary”: text-lg font-semibold

Section labels (“HIGHLIGHTS”): text-xs tracking-widest uppercase text-slate-500

B) Redesign the highlight/concern card header row

Current cards are clean but visually flat. Add a standard header bar:

Left: timestamp badge

Middle: category pill

Right: severity pill (concerns only)

This improves scanability and density.

C) Add “Expand” (progressive disclosure)

Default card content should be 2–3 lines, with “Expand” to read more. This prevents the page from looking empty and reduces scroll.

D) Give the Executive Summary more presence

Right now it reads like a plain text block.

Make it a Card

Add a small “Key takeaway” line at top (1 sentence)

Use better line-height and slightly larger text

E) Add subtle section framing

To make it feel modern:

Use bg-white/70 backdrop-blur (optional)

Use border border-slate-200/70

Use consistent shadow shadow-card

3) A “coding agent brief” you can paste

Objective: Improve typography hierarchy, reduce excess whitespace, unify components using Tailwind tokens, and tighten layout while keeping the existing information architecture.

Tasks:

Add Tailwind design tokens (font stack with Noto Sans TC, radius, shadows, border color) in tailwind.config.

Set global base typography in index.css: text-[17px] leading-[1.75]. Ensure Traditional Chinese reads comfortably.

Refactor core UI primitives into reusable components: Card, Badge, Pill, SeverityPill, SectionHeader, Panel using Tailwind + variants.

Refactor highlight/concern cards to a single component with consistent header row and “Expand” disclosure.

Tighten spacing: reduce common gap-* and p-* values by ~20–30% inside cards/sections while keeping outer page margins.

Make right column sticky with internal scroll and convert “Target response data” into Tabs or Accordion to reduce vertical sprawl.

Definition of done:

Typography feels clearly tiered (header > card title > body > labels)

UI looks denser but still calm

Right column no longer forces a second long scroll

Visual system is consistent: same radii, borders, shadows, pill styles everywhere
