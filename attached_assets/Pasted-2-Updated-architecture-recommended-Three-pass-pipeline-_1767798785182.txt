2. Updated architecture (recommended)
Three-pass pipeline (simple, robust)

Pass A — Deterministic coverage

Ensure all highlights / concerns are included

Assign section structure

No conversational polish yet

Pass B — Conversational naturalization (LLM)

Rewrite into speech-native text

No audio tags yet (important)

Output clean conversational script

Pass C — Audio markup injection (lightweight)

Add ElevenLabs audio tags at section or line level

Do NOT change wording here

Only annotate emotional intent

This separation keeps your system debuggable and avoids chaos.

3. The Naturalization Prompt (updated, final version)

This is the prompt you should use in Pass B.

System instruction
You are a professional editor for spoken voice notes and film review podcasts.

Your task is to rewrite a structured reviewer transcript into a natural, conversational, first-person spoken reflection, as if the reviewer is thinking out loud shortly after watching the film.

This is NOT an essay and NOT a report reading.
It should sound like a human voice memo.

User prompt (drop-in)
You are given a JSON object representing a reviewer voice script with sections and short draft lines.

Rewrite ONLY the `text` fields inside `sections[].lines[]` so the result sounds like natural speech.

Speech style requirements:
- First-person throughout.
- Reflective, fluid, and conversational.
- Use natural transitions (“One thing that stayed with me…”, “That said…”, “What I kept thinking about was…”, “If I’m being honest…”).
- Occasionally acknowledge uncertainty or subjectivity (“for me”, “personally”, “at this point”).
- Avoid list-reading or enumeration.
- Avoid phrases like “highlight”, “concern”, “issue number”.
- Each line max 2 sentences.

Tone:
- Match the reviewer persona’s tone (direct vs warm).
- Sound like someone speaking to a filmmaker they respect.

Hard constraints:
- Keep the same language as the input.
- Do NOT change JSON structure.
- Do NOT modify or remove `refs`.
- Do NOT add new timestamps or events.
- Do NOT invent new observations.
- Do NOT add audio tags in this step.

Target length:
- ~650–850 English words OR ~900–1400 Traditional Chinese characters total.

Here is the input JSON. Return the rewritten JSON only:

<PASTE VoiceReportScript JSON HERE>


This prompt alone will already make a night-and-day difference.

4. Audio tag injection (Pass C)

Once you have a good conversational script, add audio tags sparingly.

Rule of thumb

Tags at section starts, not every line

1–2 tags per section max

Never stack tags

Suggested mapping
Section	Recommended tag
OPEN	[thoughtfully]
HIGHLIGHTS	[warmly] or [engaged]
CONCERNS	[carefully] or [seriously]
OBJECTIVES	[reflective]
CLOSE	[encouraging]
Example (after Pass B)
[thoughtfully] I just finished watching this, and a few things really stayed with me.

[engaged] One moment that genuinely pulled me in was around 12:55. I felt the pacing settle, and suddenly the emotional stakes became much clearer to me.

[carefully] There were also points where I felt my attention start to drift. Around 34 minutes in, I wasn’t entirely sure what I was meant to hold onto emotionally, and that distance added up for me.

[encouraging] Overall, I think the film is closest to working when it trusts those quieter moments and lets them breathe.


These tags guide delivery, they don’t replace writing.

5. ElevenLabs API settings (recommended defaults)

Your dev got good values already. I’d lock these as defaults:

{
  "model_id": "eleven_multilingual_v2",
  "voice_settings": {
    "stability": 0.45,
    "similarity_boost": 0.75,
    "style": 0.0,
    "use_speaker_boost": true
  }
}


Notes:

Slightly lower stability (0.45–0.5) helps conversational variance

Keep style at 0 unless you want exaggeration

Voice choice matters more than tuning

6. Do NOT rely on ElevenLabs for these things

Important to tell your agent explicitly:

❌ Do not expect ElevenLabs to:

add transitions

reorganize thoughts

fix report-like structure

reduce repetition

invent conversational flow

That must be done upstream.
