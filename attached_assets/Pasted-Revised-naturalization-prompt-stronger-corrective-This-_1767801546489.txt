Revised naturalization prompt (stronger, corrective)

This replaces your current Pass B prompt.

System instruction (UPDATED)
You are rewriting professional film notes into a spoken, first-person voice memo.

This must sound like a real human thinking out loud after a screening.
Not a report. Not a lecture. Not written notes read aloud.

Imagine the reviewer is alone, recording a private voice memo to themselves.

User prompt (UPDATED — this matters)
Rewrite ONLY the `text` fields inside `sections[].lines[]` to sound like natural spoken reflection.

MANDATORY RULES:
- Do NOT start any sentence with a timestamp (e.g. “At 02:13”).
- If a timestamp is mentioned, it must appear later in the sentence, or after an initial clause.
- Do NOT use report verbs like “establishes”, “demonstrates”, “undermines”, “reduces credibility”.
- Replace them with experiential language (“what this did for me…”, “this is where I felt…”, “it started to feel…”).

Speech requirements:
- First-person, reflective, slightly imperfect.
- Include metacognition: noticing, remembering, reacting.
- Vary sentence openings (“One thing that stayed with me…”, “What surprised me was…”, “By the time we get to…”).
- Allow mild subjectivity (“for me”, “personally”, “I kept feeling like…”).
- Each line max 2 sentences.

Tone:
- Still professional.
- Still intelligent.
- But spoken, not written.

Hard constraints:
- Keep the same language as input.
- Do NOT change JSON structure.
- Do NOT modify or remove refs.
- Do NOT add new events or timestamps.
- Do NOT summarize multiple highlights into one.

Here is the input JSON. Return rewritten JSON only.

5. Example: how ONE paragraph should change
Your current version
Around 02:13, Mary jokes with Isla and Charlie about the sex of the baby while preparing for the induction. Establishes a crucial baseline of warmth and normalcy.

What you want instead
One of the first moments that really grounded me comes early on, when Mary is joking with Isla and Charlie about the baby’s sex, around 02:13. That lightness mattered for me, because it made everything that followed feel like a genuine loss rather than just narrative tragedy.


Notice:

timestamp is embedded

reaction first, analysis second

no report verbs

human memory framing (“one of the first moments that grounded me”)

6. Example: concern rewrite
Current
At 03:52, Repetitive transition shots of Mary walking down corridors.. These moments slow the narrative momentum.

Better
There’s a stretch early on where I started to feel the momentum dip, especially with the repeated corridor walks around 03:52. I understood what the film was trying to establish, but for me, the repetition began to feel like it was filling space rather than adding tension.

7. Audio tags: dial them down, not up

Right now you’re tagging every section, which makes the delivery feel artificial.

New rule

Max 1 audio tag per section

Never tag individual sentences

Let the text carry emotion

Example:

[thoughtfully] One of the first moments that really stayed with me comes early on…


That’s it. No more until the next section.

8. Optional but powerful: add a “memory frame” sentence per section

In Pass A (deterministic step), prepend a line like:

“A few moments kept resurfacing for me…”

“There were also a couple of places where I felt myself pull back…”

Then let Pass B rewrite it naturally.

This gives the LLM permission to think in memory, not bullets.

9. What NOT to do

❌ Do not ask ElevenLabs to “sound more conversational” via settings

❌ Do not add more filler words mechanically (“you know”, “like”)

❌ Do not increase audio tag density

❌ Do not shorten sentences further — this is not about brevity
