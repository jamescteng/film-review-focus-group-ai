Yes—the agent suggestions are pointing you in the right direction, and the error message you’re seeing is a known Express v5 migration break.

### What’s happening

In **Express v5**, route patterns are parsed by a stricter `path-to-regexp`. An **unnamed wildcard** like:

```ts
app.get('/*', ...)
app.get('*', ...)
```

can throw:

* `Missing parameter name at index ...: /*`

because `*` is treated like a modifier that must be attached to a **named** parameter. Express’ own migration guide calls this out. ([Express][1])

### Do the agent suggestions make sense?

* **Suggestion #1 (`app.get('*', ...)`)**
  This used to be the classic Express v4 catch-all. In **v5 it may still fail** (many people report `*` and `/*` both erroring). So it’s not the most reliable fix for your deployment. ([GitHub][2])

* **Suggestion #2 (`app.get('/*splat', ...)`)**
  This is the **correct v5-style wildcard** and aligns with the official migration guide. ([Express][1])

### The most reliable SPA catch-all (Express v5)

Use the migration-guide patterns:

* `/*splat` matches everything **except** `/`
* `/{*splat}` matches everything **including** `/`

For an SPA, you usually want to serve `index.html` for both:

```ts
// after your API routes and after static middleware
app.get('/{*splat}', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../dist/index.html'));
});
```

That `/{*splat}` form is explicitly recommended by Express for including the root path. ([Express][1])

### Two operational gotchas to avoid

1. **Order matters:** `express.static(...)` and your API routes must come **before** the catch-all, or you’ll serve `index.html` for JS/CSS/API calls.
2. **Don’t swallow API routes:** Make sure your `/api/...` handlers are defined before the SPA catch-all.

If you tell me which Express major version you’re deploying (4.x vs 5.x) and whether you have an `/api` prefix, I can suggest the exact route ordering that avoids the common “SPA eats my API/static assets” failure mode.
